    <h1>It's gonna be...What?</h1>
    
        <p>The song, <em>It's Gonna Be Me</em> by late 90s/Early 2000s boyband, *Nsync, has one of the most common misheard lyrics.</p>
        
        <p><em>Baby, when you finally
        <br>get to love somebody, guess what?
        <br>It's gonna be <strong>May.</strong></em></p>
       
        <p>At this point, we all know that the actual line is <em>It's gonna be <strong>Me.</strong></em> But because the internet exists, most of us can look forward to getting flooded with the meme.</p>

    <h1>I like roly butts and I cannot lie</h1>
    
   
        <p>When my brother, cousins, and I were kids, we misquoted Shaggy's <em>Mr. Boombastic</em> all of the time. The lyrics we used were:</p>
        
        <p> <em>She call me Mr. Boombastic, silly, fantastic
        <br><strong>touch me on the butt and see how it roll, roll.</strong></em></p>
        
        <div class="tooltip">Hover for correct lyrics
            <span class="tooltiptext"><p><em>She call me Mr. Boombastic,say Me Fantastic
                touch me on the back, she says I'm mr. Ro-Ro.</em></p></span></div>

        <p>First of all, we were <strong>way</strong> too young to even have been listening to Shaggy.
        <br>Second of all, I honestly didn't know what the actual lyrics were until a few years ago</p>

        <p>The <em>Ro-Ro</em> lyric is drawn out with the addition of <em>mantic</em> to make the word <em>Romantic.</em></p>
        
        <p>So, I've pretty much spent almost all of my life wondering what a <em>mantic</em> was.</p>
