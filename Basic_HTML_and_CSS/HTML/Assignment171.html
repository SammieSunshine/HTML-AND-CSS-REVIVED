				&#34 It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man
				<br>in possession of a goodfortune, must be in want of a wife.&#34

				<br><b>- Elizabeth Bennet, <b></p>
				
				<p>Out of <i>all</i> of the books I've read, Pride and Prejudice has remained my absolute favorite for so many reasons.<br>
				<br>The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, has no real interest in getting married for the sake of just getting married. No matter how well-meaning her mother may seem in her efforts to push all of her daughters into quickly being wed, Elizabeth just rolls her eyes and attempts to go on about her life.</p>

				<br><p>...Until rumors make their way all over town of a wealthy family with an eligible bachelor moves in next door</p>
				
				<p>For years, I had had Jane Austin's classic on my book list. However, it wasn't until I came across a modern adaptation on YouTube &copy; that caused me to rush to the book store for a copy.</p>
