	<p> Are you a cat person? or A pupper person?
	personally, I'm an anything-with-fur kind of person. But PUPPERS?! They're just always happy to see their fur parent! Though, I'm not a fur parent(note: yet!) I'm more likely to get a dog instead of a cat. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE cats and have lived with them... But they're as moody as I am.</p>
